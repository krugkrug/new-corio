# LLM Coding Workflow Skill

A Claude Code skill for AI-augmented software engineering — structured planning, two collaboration modes (interactive pair programming and autonomous delegation), human accountability, and continuous learning. Synthesized from Addy Osmani's methodology, Anthropic's agentic coding research, and 30+ real-world projects.

## What This Is

This is a **skill** for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) (also works in [Cowork](https://claude.ai)). Once installed, it gives Claude a systematic framework for AI-assisted development that prevents wasted cycles and enables increasingly autonomous execution where appropriate.

The core idea: the human engineer is the accountable owner; the AI is a capable collaborator whose autonomy scales with the quality of the prompt. Well-scoped delegation with clear acceptance criteria is not "blind trust" — it is a higher-leverage operating mode.

## Two Collaboration Modes

| Mode | When | How |
|------|------|-----|
| **Pair Mode** (Conductor) | Ambiguous problems, design decisions, learning new domains | Interactive back-and-forth; AI as thought partner |
| **Delegation Mode** (Orchestrator) | Well-scoped tasks with clear acceptance criteria | Structured prompt → autonomous execution → human review |

The skill teaches Claude when to use each mode and how to scale guardrails with scope.

## The Principles

### 0. Interview Before Planning (new in v2.1)

Before you plan, make sure you're planning the right thing. Most people show up with a solution in their head ("build me a dashboard") when the real need is something different ("I need three numbers emailed to me every Monday"). One prompt closes the gap:

> *"I'm about to start this project. Interview me until you have 95% confidence about what I actually want, not what I think I should want."*

This flips the dynamic. Instead of you pitching an idea and hoping the AI reads your mind, the AI asks the questions that surface assumptions you didn't know you were making. Five minutes of interviewing saves five hours of rework — especially valuable in Delegation Mode where a wrong spec means everything downstream is wrong.

### 1–10. The Core Principles

1. **Plan before coding** — Rapid "waterfall in 15 minutes" planning before any implementation
2. **Break work into small chunks** — Focused, manageable tasks instead of monolithic requests
3. **Provide extensive context** — Relevant files, docs, patterns, and constraints loaded before each task
4. **Choose the right model** — Strategic model switching based on task type (reasoning vs. speed vs. integration)
5. **Leverage agents across the lifecycle** — Pair Mode for interactive work, Delegation Mode for well-scoped autonomous execution
6. **Maintain human accountability** — You own the output; review depth scales with delegation scope
7. **Use granular commits** — Every passing test is a save point; commit early, commit often
8. **Customize AI behavior** — Rules files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules) that encode team conventions
9. **Embrace testing and automation** — CI/CD pipelines as feedback loops for AI-generated code
10. **Continuous learning** — Review AI decisions, debug mistakes, track what works

## Getting Started

### Install as a Claude Code skill

```bash
# Option 1: Copy into your project
cp SKILL.md /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/llm-coding-workflow/SKILL.md

# Option 2: Add to your home directory for global access
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/llm-coding-workflow
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/llm-coding-workflow/SKILL.md
```

### Start using it

The skill activates automatically when you work on development tasks. You can also invoke it explicitly:

```
/llm-workflow plan "Implement user authentication with JWT"
/llm-workflow implement --chunk-size small
/llm-workflow review --commit
```

Or use natural language:

- *"Plan out the auth feature before we start coding"*
- *"Interview me about what I actually need before we plan"*
- *"Break this into smaller tasks"*
- *"Review what we just wrote before committing"*

## How It Works

### Interview Phase (new in v2.1)
You describe what you want. Claude interviews you until it has 95% confidence about the real need — separating the *what* from the *why* before planning begins. This surfaces assumptions and prevents the most expensive mistake: building the wrong thing.

### Planning Phase
The plan gets created — requirements, edge cases, technical constraints, task decomposition, risk assessment — in about 15 minutes. This prevents building the wrong thing at the wrong scale.

### Implementation Phase (Pair Mode)
Interactive back-and-forth. The plan gets broken into small chunks. Claude implements one chunk at a time, you review, test, and commit before moving on. Best for ambiguous problems and design decisions.

### Implementation Phase (Delegation Mode)
You write a clear spec with acceptance criteria, hand it off, and review the deliverable against the spec. Best for well-scoped tasks where you'd trust the output after a code review. The skill includes a delegation prompt template and pre-delegation checklist.

### Review Phase
Review depth scales with delegation scope: a single-file fix needs a diff review; a feature needs spec review + test pass + code review; multi-service changes need integration tests + manual QA. Infrastructure and security stay in pair mode.

### Commit Phase
Granular commits after each successful chunk. If something goes wrong three steps later, you roll back to the last good state instead of untangling a massive diff.

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/llm-workflow plan "[feature]"` | Create a detailed implementation plan |
| `/llm-workflow decompose "[task]"` | Break a large task into chunks |
| `/llm-workflow implement` | Implement the current chunk |
| `/llm-workflow review` | Review generated code |
| `/llm-workflow test` | Run tests for affected code |
| `/llm-workflow commit` | Commit with auto-generated message |
| `/llm-workflow debug "[issue]"` | Analyze and fix a bug |
| `/llm-workflow refactor [file]` | Modernize legacy code |

## Configuration

Create `.llm-workflow.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "workflow": {
    "chunkSize": "small",
    "autoCommit": true,
    "autoTest": true,
    "humanReview": "required"
  }
}
```

See `SKILL.md` for the full configuration reference.

## Anti-Patterns This Prevents

- **Monolithic requests** — "Build me the entire feature" produces worse results than 8 focused chunks
- **Blind trust** — Delegating without acceptance criteria or review is not delegation, it's abdication
- **Context starvation** — The less context you provide, the more the AI guesses (badly)
- **Model loyalty** — Sticking with one model when it's clearly stuck
- **Big commits** — Hard to debug, impossible to roll back cleanly
- **One-mode thinking** — Using only interactive mode when delegation would be faster, or only delegation when the problem needs exploration
- **Skipping the interview** — Jumping straight to planning without validating the actual need

## Background

This skill synthesizes Addy Osmani's LLM coding workflow (Google Chrome engineering lead), Anthropic's agentic coding research, Harper Reed's spec-driven pipeline, and patterns from 30+ real-world projects. v2.1 adds a "Principle 0" interview step that surfaces assumptions before planning begins — the single highest-ROI addition from real-world use.

The operating model: interview, plan, delegate, review, own.
